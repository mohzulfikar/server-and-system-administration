## 1. Creating the Instance

Choose Ubuntu 18.04 AMI, don't forget to set the security group with an additional rule to allow inbound connection on port 80 (well, actually i think we should learn how to automate this in the future).

![create instance](img/001.png)

Open SSH connection to the server.

![ssh](img/002.png)

The command i run on the screenshot is to set database name environtment variable for wordpress. Do the following command to initialize setup.

```bash
export wordpress_db_name="your_wpdb_name"
```

```bash
export db_root_password="your_wpdb_password"
```

Please take a note that you MUST NOT do this (specify the password in plaintext) in the production environtment.

And then, update the instance

## 2. Installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP)

Install the webserver, database, and PHP with the following command

```bash
# Installing apache2
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils -y  
$ sudo systemctl start apache2  
$ sudo systemctl enable apache2  

# Installing php and the required library
$ apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y

# Installing mysql with the environtment variable provided before
$ sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password $db_root_password"
$ sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password $db_root_password"
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client -y 
```

## 3. Wordpress Installation and Configuration

To get the wordpress webapp, simply curl or get the latest version of wordpress from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz) and extract it to the specified directory

```bash
$ sudo rm /var/www/html/index.*
$ sudo curl -L http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz --output wordpress.tar.gz
$ sudo tar -xzf wordpress.tar.gz

# Copy the wordpress webapp to www/html with rsync
$ sudo rsync -a wordpress/* /var/www/html/

# Change the ownership
$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/  
$ sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/  
```

The question is, why i use `rsync` instead of regular `cp` command? Well, `rsync -a` or archive mode is one of many ways to copy one file or directory with preserving the metadata of the file itself (date, owner, etc.).

## 4. Database Configuration

The next step is connecting the database to our wordpress. We can achive this by using the following command

```bash
$ sudo mysql -u root -p$db_root_password <<QUERY_INPUT
CREATE DATABASE $wordpress_db_name;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $wordpress_db_name.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$db_root_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT
QUERY_INPUT 
```

The above command simply said to create new database and grant the privileges of modifying that database to root with specified password. Of course, **WE CAN ONLY** do this on development environtment ðŸ™‚. In the production, we can create new user and grant the database previleges to that user.

After that, we can configure wp-config.php to specify our database name and password.

```bash
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ sudo mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php

# Replace some value with stream editor
$ sudo sed -i -r "s/database_name_here/$wordpress_db_name/g" wp-config.php
$ sudo sed -i -r "s/username_here/root/g" wp-config.php
$ sudo sed -i -r "s/password_here/$db_root_password/g" wp-config.php
```

As you can see, we can automate to replace file content with stream editor. You can check the man pages for more details.

## 5. Finishing the Instalation

Install required module for php and apache2

```bash
$ sudo a2enmod rewrite  

# mcrypt in php7 by default isn't supported
$ sudo php5enmod mcrypt
```

Don't forget to installing phpmyadmin for managing your database (optional). If there's a popup open, choose apache2.

```bash
# Install and configure phpmyadmin
$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin -y
$ echo 'Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf' >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

![phpmyadmin setting](img/004.png)

Finally, restart apache and mysql service and clean up downloaded file (wordpress.tar.gz)

```bash
cd $home
sudo rm -rf wordpress.tar.gz wordpress
```

## 6. Wordpress Blog Setup

Visit the instance IP and you should see wordpress installation page as follow,

![wp-setup 1](img/005.png)

Create new user and password for your wordpress
![wp-setup 2](img/006.png)

Login to the wp-admin page with previous credential

![wp-setup 3](img/007.png)

You should see wp-admin dashboard page, here you can manage your wordpress site interactively and install additional plugin.

![wp dashboard](img/008.png)

You can visit the IP once again to see the default looks of the website.

![wp welcome page](img/009.png)

Take a note that, i'm running the wordpress 5.5.1, should you see some difference in the default look is probably because you installed a different version of WordPress (the latest version now as i wrote this is 5.6), you can change it on wp-admin page.

## 7. The Script

You can see my script on this [link](script.sh)
