## 1. Creating the Instance

Choose Ubuntu 18.04 AMI, don't forget to set the security group with an additional rule to allow inbound connection on port 80 (well, actually i think we should learn how to automate this in the future).

Open SSH connection to the server.

The command i run on the screenshot is to set database name environtment variable for wordpress. Do the following command to initialize setup.

```bash
$ export wordpress_db_name="your_wpdb_name"
```

```bash
$ export db_root_password="your_wpdb_password"
```

Please take a note that you MUST NOT do this (specify the password in plaintext) in the production environtment.

And then, update the instance

## 2. Installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP)

Install the webserver, database, and PHP with the following command
```bash
# Installing apache2
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils -y  
$ sudo systemctl start apache2  
$ sudo systemctl enable apache2  

# Installing php and the required library
$ apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y

# Installing mysql with the environtment variable provided before
$ sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password $db_root_password"
$ sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password $db_root_password"
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client -y 
```

## 3. Wordpress Installation and Configuration

To get the wordpress webapp, simply curl or get the latest version of wordpress from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz) and extract it to the specified directory

```bash
$ sudo rm /var/www/html/index.*
$ sudo curl -L http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz --output wordpress.tar.gz
$ sudo tar -xzf wordpress.tar.gz

# Copy the wordpress webapp to www/html with rsync
$ sudo rsync -a wordpress/* /var/www/html/

# Change the ownership
$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/  
$ sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/  
```

The question is, why i use `rsync` instead of regular `cp` command? Well, `rsync -a` or archive mode is one of many ways to copy one file or directory with preserving the metadata of the file itself (date, owner, etc.).

## 4. Database Configuration

The next step is connecting the database to our wordpress. We can achive this by using the following command

```bash
$ sudo mysql -u root -p$db_root_password <<QUERY_INPUT
CREATE DATABASE $wordpress_db_name;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $wordpress_db_name.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$db_root_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT
QUERY_INPUT 
```

The above command simply said to create new database and grant the privileges of modifying that database to root with specified password. Of course, **WE CAN ONLY** do this on development environtment ðŸ™‚. In the production, we can create new user and grant the database previleges to that user.

After that, we can configure wp-config.php to specify our database name and password.

```bash
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ sudo mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
$ sudo sed -i -r "s/database_name_here/$wordpress_db_name/g" wp-config.php
$ sudo sed -i -r "s/username_here/root/g" wp-config.php
$ sudo sed -i -r "s/password_here/$db_root_password/g" wp-config.php
```

As you can see, we can automate to replace file content with stream editor. You can check the man pages for more details.
