# DNS Server with EC2

In this project, I was assigned to create DNS server with EC2 instance with group of 3 students.

This is basically a team project, i teamed up with [Fikri](wuvel.net) and [Rafi](rafifauz.site). Also, i actually have to redo the assignment because our submission is not actually what the project intended too (we don't delegate zone, thus we basically just add A record on our DNS record). I also read [this](https://badshah.io/how-i-hosted-a-dns-server-on-aws/) and [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/
how-to-configure-bind-as-a-private-network-dns-server-on-ubuntu-18-04) guide for this project. You should see their website too! :)
